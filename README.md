# gazRobot1
My code for robot1 that has two motors controlled by 1 hbridge and 1 Ultsonic Sensor that sits ontop of 1 servo.
so the sensor can scan left, right and ahead.
this is controlled by a raspberry pi model two.
I have uploaded the code written in python 3 which has a simple AI for avoidance.
feel free to use as you wish
